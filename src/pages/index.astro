				I studied Political Science at the University of Kentucky. The goal of my studies was to understand
				human behavior and how to predict it through data and analytics. For over 20 years, I have predicted
				human behavior through deductive analysis. From marketing to political campaigns, I've helped brands
				make more informed decisions. Understanding human behavior is the key in persuading voters and consumers
				alike.
